### Why
 I use google tasks for all my work related todos. There is currently no desktop application to for google tasks. So I need a native way to keep to have a quick view on them in my editor. I usually write the individual items that I am working on in a TODO.md file. Hence to automate this process I made following. 

### How to install
 Currently this is not made to serve people and is a temporary hack for my personal usage. Will probably make this servable if anyone else requests this. Open a issue if you want me t.

### TODOs
 - [] Create a sync command to automatically update the edited TODOs to Google tasks
 - [] Children items should be nested inside of the parent
